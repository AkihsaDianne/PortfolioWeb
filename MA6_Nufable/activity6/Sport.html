            <h2>Quick Breakdown</h2><br>
            <p class="Nomargins">Luksong tinik (English: "jumping over thorns") is a popular game in the Philippines. It is originated in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, played by two teams with equal numbers of players. Each team designates a leader, the nanay (mother), while the rest of the players are called anak (children). The players chosen to be nanay are usually the ones who can jump the highest. The game involves players sitting on the ground and other players jumping over parts of their body. Basically, you just jump over people's feet which is meant to be the tinik, which one foot/hand of the two players sitting on the ground will be added after all players have jumped the first round.In Myanmar, a similar game is known as Hpan Khone and is played mostly by girls.This game can be challenging and is in the category Traditional Filipino games.</p> <hr>

            <h2>How to play Luksong Tinik:</h2><br>
            <p class="Nomargins"> 1) The first team decides among themselves who will play first and who will be the two who will act as the “thorns” in the game. Thorns have a very important as well as difficult task in the game. Jumpers take turns passing the levels. The jumpers form a queue and the thorns take their position.
                <br><br>2) The “thorns” A sit, facing each other with the soles of their feet touching. This is the first level that jumpers must successfully jump through without touching any of their body parts with those of the thorns’ body parts.
                <br><br>3) Next level the two thorns must adjust their distance a bit towards each other so they can comfortably and successfully create level 2, where one of “thorn A’s” foot is used as base, and another of “thorn B’s” foot as the second level above the base.
                <br><br>4) Then it is thorn A’s foot as base, thorn B’s foot as second layer of base then thorn A’s other foot as 3rd level.
            <br> <br>5) Then is both A and B’s feet alternating to create level 4. Then it is all four feet plus thorn A’s hand: Level 5. A & B’s feet and one hand each: Level 6. A& B’s feet and two of A’s hands and B’s one hand: Level 7. Finally Level 8 has all four hands and feet alternating.
                <br><br>6) Successful jumpers are cleared and pass on to the next level. The group decides how many tries will be given for each attempt. For example, you get one more try. So if you were unsuccessful the first attempt, you step aside and wait till everyone has their turn jumping over the “thorns”. After this, all the unsuccessful ones take their second attempt. If you still did not clear that level, you are out of the game and spend the remaining time watching the rest of the kids complete all the rounds. Then you are candidate for the thorns so that the thorns of the current game can take their turn as jumpers in the next game.</p>

            <h2>History Of Luksong Tinik</h2><br>
            <p class="Nomargins">Luksong Tinik, or thorn hurdles, is a traditional game played by children in the Philippines. The game is typically played by girls between the ages of seven to 12, and play requires between four and eight participants.The participants are separated into two equal teams. The participants choose two players, typically those who can jump the highest, to be the mothers. The remaining participants are the children. The object of the game is for the mothers and children to jump over the outstretched hands of the other players. <br><br>

                One team becomes the base and has two children sit facing each other with their right feet touching, while the other team’s participants are to jump over the feet. The non-jumping team’s participants place one hand above the feet with palms and fingers spread open, reaching as high as they can. Then another hand is placed over the top of the previous hand after the participants jump, and so on.
                <br><br>
                If the participants jump over the hands successfully without touching any part of the hands with their body or clothes, they become jumpers again. When the participant touches the any part of the base, it is considered a fault. If one of the children touches the base, the mother jumps in her place. If the mother is the one who fails to jump over the hands, then the teams switch places and the team on the base becomes the jumpers.
